# Apogee

Apogee is a reactive JavaScript IDE and runtime that offers a unique coding approach. Instead of traditional code, Apogee allows you to define field values, akin to a system of equations. The runtime then automatically calculates the values of all fields, determining the calculation order based on field dependencies.

## Field Definitions

Field definitions in Apogee are used to define variables or constants using the `:=` operator. Fields in Apogee are immutable, meaning their values cannot be modified after assignment. The order of field definitions doesn't matter, as the runtime resolves dependencies internally.

Data fields and function fields are the two types supported by Apogee. Data fields are computed by functions and can hold any JavaScript value, including functions. Function fields, on the other hand, have values that are the functions themselves.

## Transient Fields and the Messenger

Apogee introduces a field type called "transient" fields, defined using the ":~" operator. Transient fields are similar to data fields but have some limitations. They cannot depend on other fields and can be considered as "initial condition" values. Transient field values can be modified using the "messenger".

The messenger is a mechanism that updates the values of transient fields. It allows setting new values asynchronously, triggering a recalculation with a new model after the previous calculation finishes.

Transient fields and the messenger are illustrated in an example, where the initial value of `x` is set to 0. The values of `y` and `z` depend on `x`, and the messenger updates the value of `x`. Once the model calculation is complete, the messenger triggers an update, resulting in new field values.

In summary, Apogee provides a reactive programming model where field values are computed automatically based on dependencies. Transient fields and the messenger offer a way to modify field values asynchronously, generating new models for recalculations without modifying the values during the calculation process.

// I was picking on ChatGPT and asked it to explain the react example. It got the update part wrong so 
// I asked it to update the description. (I did change his code a little since it had a const count = buttonCount at the top of
// the react element that I replaced with using buttonCount directly inline.)
// It also added the arrow in there, which is ok but uneccessary.
// I'll keep this but I probably want to work on this some.  

Apologies for the confusion earlier. You are correct that in Apogee, when the messenger updates the value of `buttonCount`, all fields that depend on `buttonCount` will be recalculated, including the "side effect only" field that creates the React element. The Apogee runtime ensures that the field dependencies are resolved and updated accordingly.

Here's an improved version of the document to clarify this behavior:

Apogee introduces a field type called "transient" fields, defined using the ":~" operator. Transient fields are similar to data fields but have some limitations. They cannot depend on other fields and can be considered as "initial condition" values. Transient field values can be modified using the "messenger".

The messenger is a mechanism that updates the values of transient fields. When a field value is updated using the messenger, all fields that depend on that field will be recalculated. This ensures that the entire model remains consistent.

For example, let's consider the following code snippet:

```javascript
buttonCount :~ 34

<CounterButton> := () {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    postMsg("buttonCount", buttonCount + 1);
  };

  return (
    <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>
      Click me! Count: {buttonCount}
    </button>
  );
};
```

In this example, we have a transient field `buttonCount` initially set to 34. The `CounterButton` field depends on `buttonCount` to determine the value of `count`. When the button is clicked, the messenger updates the value of `buttonCount` by incrementing it by 1. As a result, all fields that depend on `buttonCount`, including the `CounterButton` field, are recalculated. This leads to the updated value of `count` being reflected in the rendered React element, causing the displayed count to increase by 1.

Apogee ensures that the recalculation process considers the dependencies among fields, allowing for consistent updates throughout the model. The messenger plays a crucial role in triggering these updates and maintaining the reactive behavior of the defined fields.

# Given the token limit on the chat transactions, is there a recommended way to pass information in to you? 




When working within the token limit of the chat interface, it is recommended to provide the information in a concise and clear manner. Here are a few suggestions to effectively communicate information within the token limit:

1. Prioritize key points: Identify the most important information you want to convey and focus on those points. Eliminate any unnecessary details or explanations that are not essential to your question or request.

2. Use bullet points or numbered lists: Organize your information using bullet points or numbered lists. This helps in presenting information in a structured and easy-to-read format.

3. Break down complex information: If you have complex information to convey, break it down into smaller, digestible chunks. Present each part separately and provide a summary or overview to give context.

4. Provide relevant examples: When explaining concepts or providing examples, choose concise and relevant examples that illustrate your point effectively without excessive details.

5. Be specific and direct: Clearly state your question or request in a concise manner, avoiding unnecessary background information. This allows the AI to focus on addressing your specific inquiry.

By following these recommendations, you can make the most of the token limit and ensure effective communication within the constraints of the chat interface.
